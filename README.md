# SpeedRunEthereum Repository
This repository contains the projects and challenges completed from the SpeedRunEthereum.com tutorial series.

SpeedRunEthereum is an interactive learning platform that teaches you how to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) using Ethereum and Solidity. The platform offers a set of challenges designed to help you learn various aspects of Ethereum development, such as smart contracts, ERC20 tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.

## Projects and Challenges
Below is a list of projects and challenges included in this repository:

### Challenge 0: Simple NFT Example ✅
Learn the basics of Ethereum development by creating a simple NFT using HardHat and a React app template full of important Ethereum components and hooks.

### Challenge 1: Decentralized Staking App ✅
Build a decentralized application that allows users to coordinate a group funding effort, requiring them to trust only the code.

### Challenge 2: Token Vendor ✅
Create a decentralized digital currency (ERC20 token) and an unstoppable vending machine to buy and sell the currency, learning about the "approve" pattern for ERC20s and contract-to-contract interactions.

### Challenge 3: Dice Game
Build a dice game that leverages weak randomness in blockchain technology to predict the outcomes and win the game.

### Challenge 4: Build a DEX (Decentralized Exchange) Challenge
Develop an exchange that swaps ETH to tokens and tokens to ETH, using a smart contract that holds reserves of both assets and has a price function based on the ratio of the reserves.

### Challenge 5: A State Channel Application Challenge
Implement a state channel application to overcome the low transaction throughput and high cost of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain by allowing participants to transact off-chain securely.

### Challenge 6: Multisig Wallet Challenge
Create a multisig wallet using a smart contract to secure assets by requiring multiple accounts to "vote" on transactions, with the contract tracking transactions and owners confirming or rejecting them.

### Challenge 7: SVG NFT Building Cohort Challenge
Experiment with cutting-edge smart contracts that render SVGs in Solidity, enabling NFTs that own other NFTs to render their collections.
